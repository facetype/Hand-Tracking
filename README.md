Started as a hobby project to play around with MP hands, been expanding on it and the end goal is to make a game with physics where a line is drawn between both your index fingers
and a ball spawns which you have to balance with the platform drawn.

Some AI has been used to help with optimization or places I got stuck, as well as mediapipe documentation and opencv documentation.
